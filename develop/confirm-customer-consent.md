How to confirm customer acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement.

## Prerequisites

- If you are using the Partner Center .NET SDK, version 1.9 or newer is required.
- If you are using the Partner Center Java SDK, version 1.8 or newer is required.
- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](./partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports app + user authentication only.
- A customer ID (customer-tenant-id).
- Date when customer accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement.
- Information about the user from the organization who accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement, including:
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Email address
  - Phone number (optional)


## .NET (version 1.14 or newer)

To confirm or re-confirm customer acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement:

1. Retrieve the agreement metadata for the Microsoft Customer Agreement. You must obtain the **templateId** of the Microsoft Customer Agreement. For more details, see [Get agreement metadata for Microsoft Customer Agreement](get-agreement-metadata.md).

```csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;

string agreementType = "MicrosoftCloudAgreement";

var microsoftCloudAgreementDetails = partnerOperations.AgreementDetails.ByAgreementType(agreementType).Get().Items.Single();
```

2. Create a new **Agreement** object containing details of the confirmation.
3. Use the **IAgreggatePartner.Customers** collection and call the **ById** method with the specified **customer-tenant-id**.
4. Use the **Agreements** property, followed by calling **Create** or **CreateAsync**.

```csharp
// string selectedCustomerId;

var agreementToCreate = new Agreement
{
    DateAgreed = DateTime.UtcNow,
    TemplateId = microsoftCloudAgreementDetails.TemplateId,
    PrimaryContact = new Contact
    {
        FirstName = "Tania",
        LastName = "Carr",
        Email = "someone@example.com",
        PhoneNumber = "1234567890"
    }
};

Agreement agreement = partnerOperations.Customers.ById(selectedCustomerId).Agreements.Create(agreementToCreate);
```

A complete sample can be found in the [CreateCustomerAgreement](https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Partner-Center-SDK-Samples/blob/master/Source/Partner%20Center%20SDK%20Samples/Agreements/CreateCustomerAgreement.cs) class from the [console test app](https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Partner-Center-SDK-Samples) project.

## .NET (version 1.9 - 1.13)

To confirm or re-confirm that a customer has accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement:

1. Retrieve the agreement metadata for the Microsoft Customer Agreement. See [Get agreement metadata for Microsoft Customer Agreement](get-agreement-metadata.md) for details. This step is required to obtain the **TemplateId** of the Microsoft Customer Agreement.

    ```csharp
    /// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;
    var agreements = partnerOperations.AgreementDetails.Get();

    AgreementMetaData microsoftCloudAgreement = agreements.Items.FirstOrDefault (agr => agr.AgreementType == AgreementType.MicrosoftCloudAgreement);
    ```

2. Create a new **Agreement** object containing details of the confirmation. Then use the **IAggregatePartner.Customers** collection and call the **ById** method with the specified customer's ID. Then, call the **Agreements** property, followed by calling **Create** or **CreateAsync**.

    ``` csharp
    // string selectedCustomerId;

    var agreementToCreate = new Agreement
    {
        PrimaryContact = new Contact
        {
            FirstName = "Tania",
            LastName = "Carr",
            Email = "someone@example.com",
            PhoneNumber = "1234567890"
        },
        TemplateId = microsoftCloudAgreement.TemplateId,
        DateAgreed = DateTime.UtcNow,
        Type = AgreementType.MicrosoftCloudAgreement
    };

    Agreement agreement = partnerOperations.Customers.ById(selectedCustomerId).Agreements.Create(agreementToCreate);
    ```

## Java

[!INCLUDE [<Partner Center Java SDK support details>](<../includes/java-sdk-support.md>)]

To confirm or re-confirm that a customer has accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement:

1. Retrieve the agreement metadata for the Microsoft Customer Agreement. See [Get agreement metadata for Microsoft Customer Agreement](get-agreement-metadata.md) for details. This step is required to obtain the **TemplateId** of the Microsoft Customer Agreement.

    ```java
    /// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;

    ResourceCollection<AgreementMetaData> agreements = partnerOperations.getAgreements().get();
    AgreementMetaData microsoftCloudAgreement;

    for (AgreementMetaData metadata : agreements)
    {
        if(metadata.getAgreementType() == AgreementType.MicrosoftCloudAgreement)
        {
            microsoftCloudAgreement = metadata;
        }
    }
    ```

2. Create a new **Agreement** object containing details of the confirmation. Then use the **IAggregatePartner.getCustomers** function and call the **byId** function with the specified customer's identifier. Then, call the **getAgreements** property, followed by calling the **create** function.

    ```java
    // String selectedCustomerId;

    Contact primaryContact = new Contact();

    primaryContact.setEmail("someone@example.com");
    primaryContact.setFirstName("Tania");
    primaryContact.setLastName("Carr");
    primaryContact.setPhoneNumber("1234567890");

    Agreement agreementToCreate = new Agreement();

    agreementToCreate.setContact(primaryContact);
    agreementToCreate.setDateAgreed(new DateTime());
    agreementToCreate.setTemplateId(microsoftCloudAgreement.getTemplateId());
    agreementToCreate.setType(AgreementType.MicrosoftCloudAgreement);

    Agreement agreement = partnerOperations.getCustomers().byId(selectedCustomerId).getAgreements().create(agreementToCreate);
    ```

A complete sample can be found in the [CreateCustomerAgreement](https://github.com/Microsoft/Partner-Center-Java-Samples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/microsoft/store/partnercenter/samples/agreements/CreateCustomerAgreement.java) class from the [console test app](https://github.com/Microsoft/Partner-Center-Java-Samples) project.

## PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [<Partner Center PowerShell module support details>](<../includes/powershell-module-support.md>)]
